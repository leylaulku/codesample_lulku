This is a sample of code from a project I did for a class last semester (Intro to Object Oriented Programming). It's focus was to build a deeper understanding of recursion and data structures.
It's five functions within one file, and the other two files (namely RecursionUtils and Point) were provided by the TA to be called within our code.
