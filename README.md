# This is a sample of code from a project I did for a class last semester (Intro to Object Oriented Programming). It's focus was to build a deeper understanding of abstract classes, file I/O, and handling exceptions.

# There are five pieces of code, some of which representing objects and others overriding exceptions and providing the base framework for the whole structure.
I included a .csv file I was given for testing purposes --I would include the assignment PDF but I'm unsure whether that would violate academic honesty at my school,
so I can email it separately.
