This is a sample of code from a project I did for a class last semester (Intro to Object Oriented Programming). It's focus was to build a deeper understanding of recursion and data structures.

It's five functions within one file, and there are two other files (Point.java and RecursionUtils.java) which were NOT written by me; these were provided by the instructor to be called within the function!
